Squid_proxy file location

	vi /etc/squid/squid.conf

step 0:
change here below

# Recommended minimum configuration:
#

# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing
# should be allowed
acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8     # RFC1918 possible internal network
acl localnet src 172.16.0.0/12  # RFC1918 possible internal network
acl localnet src 192.168.5.0/24 # RFC1918 possible internal network
acl localnet src fc00::/7       # RFC 4193 local private network range
acl localnet src fe80::/10      # RFC 4291 link-local (directly plugged) machines
#main command that allow to open only specific websites.

http_access allow GOOD
http_access deny all




Step 1:

Add firewall rule to allow squid 3128 port.

firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-port=3128/tcp –permanent
 

Save rules and restart service

firewall-cmd –reload
Done configuration part now time to test browsing pointing squid ip and default port in client browser.

 

Step 2:

Open up firefox browser and go to Tools > Options > Advance tab > Network > Settings > select manual proxy settings radio button and provide squid server IP 192.168.1.100 and port 3128 and check use this use this proxy server for all protocols and then click oK
