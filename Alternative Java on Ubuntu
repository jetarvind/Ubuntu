Step 1
Download java (JDK <latest version> - X64.tar.gz) by visiting the following link
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-
1880260.html.
Then jdk-7u71-linux-x64.tar.gz will be downloaded into your system.
Step 2
Generally you will find the downloaded java file in Downloads folder. Verify it
and extract the jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz file using the following commands.
$ cd Downloads/
$ ls
jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz
$ tar zxf jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz
$ ls
jdk1.7.0_71 jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz

Step 3
To make java available to all the users, you have to move it to the location
“/usr/local/”. Open root, and type the following commands.
$ su
password:
# mv jdk1.7.0_71 /usr/local/
# exit
Step 4
For setting up PATH and JAVA_HOME variables, add the following commands
to ~/.bashrc file.
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.7.0_71
export PATH=PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
Now apply all the changes into the current running system.
$ source ~/.bashrc
Step 5
Use the following commands to configure java alternatives:
# alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java usr/local/java/bin/java 2
# alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac usr/local/java/bin/javac 2
# alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar usr/local/java/bin/jar 2
# alternatives --set java usr/local/java/bin/java
# alternatives --set javac usr/local/java/bin/javac
# alternatives --set jar usr/local/java/bin/jar
Now verify the installation using the command java -version from the terminal
as explained above
